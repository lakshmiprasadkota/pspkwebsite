In 1997, he also appeared in Suswagatham, a remake of the 1997 Tamil film Love Today </p1>
<br><br><p2> In 1998, Tholi Prema was released and won a National Award and six Nandi Awards.[21] After Tholi Prema, Pawan Kalyan acted in Thammudu, playing the role of a kick boxer. Thammudu was released on 15 July 1999 and was written and directed by P. A. Arun Prasad. Next, he acted in Puri Jagannadh's first directorial venture Badri. In 2001, he was the brand ambassador for Pepsi at the time his brother Chiranjeevi was promoting Coca-Cola.[22] </p2>
<br><br><p3> In 2001, Pawan Kalyan acted in the film Kushi. The film was released on 27 April 2001 and was directed by S. J. Surya, which became a huge hit in that year and eventually turned up as an Industry hit. His next film Johnny, written and directed by Kalyan, released on 26 April 2003. Kalyan also starred in the film, along with Renu Desai. In 2004, his film Gudumba Shankar was released. The film was directed by Veera Shankar and produced by Pawan's brother Nagendra Babu under Anjana Productions banner. The film's script and screenplay were written by Kalyan and he also choreographed three songs in this film and actions scenes were conceived and choreographed by him.[23] In 2005, the film Balu ABCDEFG, directed by A. Karunakaran was released. This was A. Karunakaran's second film with Pawan Kalyan after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Ashwini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner. In 2006, Bangaram, directed by Tamil director Dharani was released. Later that year, he appeared in Annavaram, directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao.

The film was released on 29 December 2006[24] and collected ₹230 million in 3 weeks and ₹300 million (US$4.4 million) in 70 Days.[25][26] The film was a remake of the Tamil film Thirupaachi. Pawan Kalyan also choreographed the song "Neevalle Neevalle" in this film. During March 2006, Pawan Kalyan launched his second directorial venture Satyagrahi, produced by A. M. Rathnam, which would be a tale questioning the atrocities in society. After spending a few months on pre-production by signing with P. C. Sriram and A. R. Rahman, the film was later suddenly shelved.[27] </p3>
<div class="movies"><center> <img src ="hqdefault-2.jpg" radius ="0">  <center></div>
<br><br><p4> In 2008, Jalsa, directed by Trivikram Srinivas and produced by Allu Aravind was released on 2 April. This film got the highest First day collection in Telugu film history and was also the first for any regional film in south India in a single state by that time.[28] Jalsa movie turned out to be the Highest Grosser of 2008 in Telugu Cinema.[29]
 </p4>
<br><br><p5> In 2013, he appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's Attharintiki Daaredhi. The film, released on 27 September 2013, faced problems with piracy as half of the movie got leaked to the internet prior to its release.[37] In spite of this Attharintiki Daaredhi was a blockbuster in 2013. The movie completed 100 days in 33 theaters and held the record of the highest grossing film of all time in Tollywood, surpassing the previous record of Magadheera.[38] Later, it was surpassed by Baahubali: The Beginning. Kalyan's next movie was a remake of the Hindi Movie Oh My God. The movie shooting was expected to start on 19 May, but was delayed for various reasons, like finding a heroine. The movie was named Gopala Gopala, with shooting started on 9 June.[39] It was released on 10 January 2015 and got a positive response. In 2014, a STAR India survey ranked Pawan Kalyan as one of the Top 5 Heroes of India.[40]   </p5>
